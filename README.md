Algorithm Visualization

ðŸ“š Introduction

This project visualizes various algorithms using C++ with graphics library. It aims to provide an interactive way to understand the internal workings of popular algorithms such as sorting techniques, searching methods, data structures, and traversal methods.

ðŸ’¡ Features

Sorting Algorithms: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort, Interchange Sort.

Searching Algorithms: Binary Search, Sequential Search.

Data Structures: Stack, Queue, Linked List, Hash Table, Binary Tree.

Graph Traversal: Breadth-First Search (BFS).
