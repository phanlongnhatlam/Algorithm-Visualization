Algorithm Visualization

📚 Introduction

This project visualizes various algorithms using C++ with graphics library. It aims to provide an interactive way to understand the internal workings of popular algorithms such as sorting techniques, searching methods, data structures, and traversal methods.

💡 Features

Sorting Algorithms: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort, Interchange Sort.

Searching Algorithms: Binary Search, Sequential Search.

Data Structures: Stack, Queue, Linked List, Hash Table, Binary Tree.

Graph Traversal: Breadth-First Search (BFS).
